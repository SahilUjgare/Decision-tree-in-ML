# Decision Tree in Machine Learning 🌳

This project demonstrates how to implement and visualize **Decision Trees** — one of the most popular and interpretable algorithms in machine learning.

## 📘 Overview

The notebook explains:

* What Decision Trees are
* How they work for classification and regression
* Step-by-step implementation using **Scikit-learn**
* Model training, visualization, and evaluation

## 🧰 Technologies Used

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Decision_tree_in_ML.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd Decision_tree_in_ML
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Decision_tree_in_ML.ipynb
   ```

## 📊 Output

The notebook includes:

* Dataset loading and preprocessing
* Decision tree training
* Visualization of the tree structure
* Model performance metrics

## 📚 Learning Goals

* Understand how decision trees split data based on features
* Learn to control overfitting using tree depth and pruning
* Visualize and interpret decision paths



Would you like me to also generate a **`requirements.txt`** file to go with it?
